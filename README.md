# SortVis

Really simple sorting algorithm visualizer in python and Tk.

It is not time accurate, which can be seen clearly in the time difference between the bubble and selection sorts on the same lists.

The implementations of the algorithms are also not 100% accurate, but they get the point across.

Usage
=====

```python3 main.py```

It should ask for which sorting algorithm and the number of numbers.

Modding
=======

Each algorithm consists of a class that takes in the list and has a function that steps through it.

Create a new file that follows the provided template. Include it in sorters.py, and main will automatically add it to the lists and run it.
